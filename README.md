# RNMR-Docs
Documentation for the use of RNMR

---

The documentation can be built into a website using the python package [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).
RNMR-Docs uses the [mkdocs-rtd-dropdown](https://github.com/cjsheets/mkdocs-rtd-dropdown) theme.
Both of these packages can be installed from PyPI using pip.
